## Description: Move |ce5ca5cActive effects|r above |ce5ca5cActive mount|r, and add |ce5ca5cResearch|r timers to |ce5ca5cCharacter|r stats UI.

; Make sure Harven's Stabled Mounts is loaded first.
; Harven hooks STATS.CreateMountSection in order to append Stabled
; mounts section below Active mount, and that hook needs to be in
; place before I swap it with CreateActiveEffectsSection.
